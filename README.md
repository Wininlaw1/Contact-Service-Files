How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
To help secure and make my program or code more functional I can always focus on commenting to allow me to come back to my code and truly understand it or for others to even. I check my code constantly and make sure I debug it as I go down the line. So that small basic errors won't take place at the end of the software. Allowing certain tasks of potential problems to be tackled in advance versus later down the line.
